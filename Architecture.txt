# Project Architecture

## Overview
This tool uses `pyshark` to read `.pcap` files and process packet summaries, allowing filtering, exporting, and suspicious traffic scanning.

### Components
- **pcap_parser.py**: Core CLI application
- **PyShark**: Wrapper for tshark packet parsing
- **TShark**: Used for exporting filtered PCAPs
- **CSV Writer**: Outputs structured logs for Splunk or Excel

### Flow
1. CLI accepts user input (file, protocol, etc.)
2. `pyshark.FileCapture` reads summaries
3. Optional filtering by protocol
4. Optional CSV or PCAP output
5. Suspicious behavior scanner evaluates each packet

# Suspicious Traffic Detection Rules

This tool includes basic behavior-based detection for common suspicious patterns:

## Rules
| Behavior             | Detection Trigger                         | Severity |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| SYN Scan             | SYN without ACK                           | High     |
| ARP Probing          | ARP "who-has" from mismatched IPs         | Low      |
| LLMNR Spoofing       | LLMNR with "is-at" or "who-has" keywords  | Medium   |
| mDNS Spoofing        | mDNS with "workgroup" keyword             | Medium   |
| Long DNS Queries     | DNS query strings over 50 characters      | Medium   |
| Internal Noise       | Protocols like LLMNR, mDNS, NBNS, ARP     | Info     |

## Notes
These checks are meant to assist in early triage. Not all detections represent active threats.
